- Trident Large and Medium missiles
    - Nerfed with slower refire rates, L and M also have different refire rate to reduce change of ai spamming synced volleys
- ORB Laser buff during systems implemented as a listener based one, it should now be more accurate and show up as normal damage instead of unkown in Detailed combat results

Changes to ship systems:
- Sun
    - Moved the ORB link buff to a passive hullmod effect
        - The hullmod buffs nearest ship with increased range, only one ship targeted, cooldown depends on buffed ship size
- Updated AMEG Timedilator
    - the time dilator system now allows shield to be on, this reduces AI's willingness to stop engaging mid system usage
    - Custom AI implementation
        - Reduces the zigzagging around profoundly, tries not to use the system too much when it's in a position to use guns
        - The AI is quite bad in using the system to get flux in close range since it likes to keep the shield turned on while being close to enemy
