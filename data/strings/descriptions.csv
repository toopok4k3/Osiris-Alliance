oas_wayfarer2,SHIP,"Wayfarer hull has been turned into a carrier by the Osiris Alliance R&D department. The carrier modification has proved its viability in combat and the blueprint spread trough the system very quickly. This hull version is a common sight as it's incredibly valuable in smaller fleets. Compared to the original Wayfarer, this version loses the frontal turrets, but no captain misses them as they can safely sit back and let the fighters deal with opposing forces.",,,
oas_viper,SHIP,"Muskrat is a voluminous tube with large fuel tanks and cargo hold. The armor casing works as a scanning block, making Muskrat a common sight for smugglers. Built with the same principles and requirements as the Rhino, it provides security and logistical capabilities for smaller fleets. It has surprisingly large mounts for a frigate, making it a perfect line defense against pirate raiders. Any ship that comes close enough will receive a hail of projectiles fed by the ammo feeding ship system.",,,
oas_crux,SHIP,"Quite a slim carrier. It has enough bulk to withstand some hits, but it should mainly stay away from the frontline, preferably escorted. It has enough armament to punch back against the frigates that try to catch it. Anything bigger will start to give it trouble, and it can't deal with flankers. It has a place in cruiser fleets, standing back and providing fighter or bombers to the battlefield.

The original contract requirements from the alliance included 4 working launch bays. The winning design worked on paper and won the bid. The ship works, but it does not match the design specs and numerous adaptations have been implemented to make it fly. The reality struck in actual testing of the design. The internal corridors and pathways could only support three wings instead of the required four. One of the most obvious glitches is the fact that the commanders sleeping punk gets too hot as a flux vent runs right behind it, separated only by a thin wall.",,,
oas_gazer,SHIP,"A new generation Osiris Alliance design. Gazer was made to deal damage from long ranges on the battlefield. It can do quick surgical strikes on demand, thanks to the medium sized ORB (Osiris Radar Ball) technology. The ORB provides new ways, unimaginable to other ship captains, to boost the battlefield situational awareness. The system allows ballistic guns to shoot accurate volleys of projectiles to far away targets. Equipped with two large composite mounts, it can even work as a dedicated missile cruiser when needed. For close quarter battles it has a single medium energy mount, as a backup, but the most praised Gazer captains rarely want to use it. Keep your friends close, but your enemies far.",,,
oas_hen,SHIP,"A captain that cares about style will easily dismiss the Hen as an ugly duckling. An experienced one will realize the alpha strike potential offered. Well armored and agile enough to meddle with other frigates. Hen can sature the space with missiles and overpower larger ships if they are not careful. You'll often encounter Hen as an escort for larger ships. However it can't stand in the way of fire too long, yet it can do deadly strikes from further distances due to the installed ORB(Osiris Radar Ball) technology.",,,
oas_hexa,SHIP,"Hexagon is an old domain mining rig, turned into a heavily armored battleship. The ship gets its name from the Hexagon shapes apparent all around its hull. The original shuttle landing pads have been turned to mount large weapons. All the outer surfaces have been treated with plenty of armor plating and coating. Two Large mining lasers have been tuned to act as weapons of war. Every flank is protected by a plathora of medium and small ballistic mounts. It's able to launch two squadrons of Spitter mining shuttles, and even has a modernized third launch bay on the starboard side that supports Fighter LPC modules. Hexagon contains a huge volume of cargo space, originally designed to hold ore. Half of this space has been modified to house large antimatter fuel tanks. Hexagon is able to take blows, and in return obliterate whatever dares to come close enough. 

The problem is speed, not firepower or the armor. At least a few commanders have had lasting mental damage when they have had to witness a carnage in front of their eyes, outside of the ships range. The hull is just a massive hunk of metal that is slow to accelerate even with the largest of engines. Latest modernization package equipped it with a ballistic drive, trying to give it more mobility on the battlefield.",,,
oas_osiris,SHIP,"Based on the classic Hexagon class. The internal systems have been upgraded to fully support an ORB installation. The ORB has been succesfully tuned to provide both plasma and laser weaponry. The first reports of Sun class were dismissed as impossible by the core factions. An altercation with rogue Onslaught was captured on video by a Hegemony spy. The recording caused a big buzz in the world of comsec. The Osiris Alliance was supposed to be a bunch of poor colonies no one should care about, and suddenly they could fight toe to toe against the biggest Battleships? A few of the top level Hegemony officials were demoted(some vanished) due to failure to handle the Osiris Alliance situation properly before they became a system wide power.",,,
oas_rhino,SHIP,"A ship designed to protect trade convoys. Rhino is based on the Unicorn hull, the legendary domain design favoured by many salvage captains. More armor was built around the already sturdy hull. The large mining laser was changed to fit any large ballistic cannon, additional PD mounts were added on the starboard side. The built in shuttle bay was modified to support modular LPC's. While the Rhino can't match speed of other hulls in its class, it can outgun and surprise them with the ballistic drive system. It's voluminous hull embodies incredible logistic capabilities and the ship is often used as a logistic ship in military fleets. Rhino is self sufficient during longer voyages and it has the ability to send a fighter wing to escort weaker ships.

Due to simple derivative additions on top of the widespread Unicorn hull, Osiris Alliance could not keep the blueprints secret and the design has spread trough every corner of the Persian system. Everyone likes a sturdy Rhino in their fleet.",,,
oas_owl,SHIP,"A new generation design based on feedback from Lasher Mk. II pilots. The largest drawback was the lack of point defense capabilities. This was fixed by adding a 360 degree ballistic mount for PD weapons. It made the hull bulky, and the design went trough numerous iterations until it no longer reminiscenced the original Lasher Mk II hit'n'run concept. It turned out into a more refined and powerful Scanner class heavy frigate, with an impressive array of frontal facing turret hardpoints. It's equipped with four small ballistic mounts, a medium missile slot to provide finishing capability that was missing in Lasher Mk II. It has a smaller version of the ORB(Osiris Radar Ball), tuned to provide brief laser bursts that can easily cut trough smaller hulls. The firepower and ORB makes it a favoured patrol ship. Smugglers have a grown a special hatred towards the Scanner.",,,
oas_lasher2,SHIP,"A cheap Lasher hull was chosen to work as a base for a speedy, but cheap, frigate to act as an interceptor and hit'n'run vessel. Most of the weapon mounts were stripped, the crew compartment now holds a medium sized ballistic hardpoint. The new crew compartment was copied from the Muskrat. The most impressive part is the brand new engine and a system that combines maneuvering jets with the lashers ammo feeder. Unlike the original Lasher, most of the cargo hold and fuel tanks have been modified to house the larger engines. The ship can still make small hyperspace trips on its own. But a support vessel is almost a requirement for the Lasher Mk. II as it's barely able to do hyperspace trips alone.",,,
oas_airo,SHIP,"A high tech frigate, equipped with an impressive weapon mount arrangement. It has immensive firepower capabilities for its size, with flux capacity to match. Also fitted with the AMEG X-Axis Time Dilator ship system, Ribcage is able to catch anyone by creating a time dilation field, seemingly traveling faster than anything else in a straight line. The technology works without the magic of p-space phasing, which has it's perks, but the crew still grows older faster and battles seem to last longer aboard the vessel than on the outside when the system is used.

No one truly knows where this blueprint came from. Holding energy monopoly in the fastest growing planet in the sector has its perks. Seemingly limitless credits can apparently hasten the spawn of a unique hull designs from the vast tech ruins. Rumours of a lucky salvage crew vanishing after a big tech find have always been associated with the Antimatter Energy Group appearing with these ships. The timing of the salvage crew vanishing and the hull designs showing up on the Orbital Works job queue matches, according to public independent news channels.",,,
oas_airo_oa,SHIP,"This is a more heavily armored ballistic version of the AMEG Ribcage high tech frigate. The internal delicate machinery components have been transformed to house a simpler ballistic drive system, as in the Lasher Mk II. It is much more cost friendly to manufacture and maintain for the alliances military organization. This comes at a cost to the flux capability and top speed.

oas_purjo,SHIP,"This weird looking destroyer has the capability to turn tides of any battle. Equipped with a fully intergrated AMEG Time Dilator, it is able to dilate time around it to travel quickly in any direction. At least it appears so to the outside world while the crew inside the bubble gets bored at the slowly moving time. Equipped with enough medium energy mounts to make bigger cruisers look underarmed. Even a newbie captain can deliver deadly alpha strikes and escape without a scratch commanding this vessel.

The timing of the salvage crew vanishing and these hull designs appearing on the Orbital Works job queues matches according to public open news channels.",,,
oas_hourglass,SHIP,"After long negotiations with the Antimatter Energy Group, the Alliance R&D group got their hands on the Time Dilator technology. Hourglass is the first class to wield it. The time Dilator device requires compromises on the armor and structural integrity to work. Engineers could not fit it in the same small space as on the original AMEG vessels and this leaves some openings in the armor. Contrary to most Alliance ships, Hourglass has been fitted with a bunch of energy mounts as the R&D department has finally gained enough knowledge on how to implement energy weapons in an easy and maintainable manner. Even with the compromised design solutions, Hourglass is one of the most advanced military crafts in the Persean sector.

The original AMEG time dilation vessel hulls were built in a way that integrated the required technology in the hull itself. Growing suspicions that these original designs could have been made by a higher intelligence. The much bulkier Hourglass design was the best the most brilliant human minds could come up with.",,,
oas_fatf,SHIP,"An armored tube filled with a small Magnetron cannon and a Matchstick missile rack. It also has an engine. Meant to deal long range preliminary strikes against ships shields.",,,
oas_lolslaught,SHIP,"A nightmare, in every possible way. You can't but imagine what could have created this behemoth version of Onslaught hull. You are not surprised when you find marks of Antimatter Energy Group around the ship hull. Truly, this ship must have been a cruel joke by whoever created it. The rumors of a possible AI design feel real when you look at this thing.",,,
oas_unicorn,SHIP,"Every explorers wet dream, unless they are rich enough to buy an apogee. A rare sight in the core systems as it is regarded mainly for long range exploration and salvage missions. Humane working conditions and human maintainable systems have made this ship a favored job designation by spacers. The ship got its name from the Heavy Mining Laser on it's front, sticking out like a unicorns alicorn.

This is one of latest hull designs created after the collapse. The original blueprint was made right after the collapse with Domain systems in mind. The design ran into multiple alterations before the first AI war, many of the original parts were no longer manufactured or attainable. New, easier to build and more human maintainable solutions were used. After the war, every hint of an AI was scrapped and human usable terminals were designed over them.",,,
oas_saltire,SHIP,"A modern carrier with enough armor to make it work as a frontline battleship. It has an impressive frontal ballistic battery, four small hardpoints and two medium ballistic turrets. On top of the command center is a large ballistic mount that can be pointed in any direction.

Saltire is the second design attempt by the Alliance to build a carrier replacement with four launch bays. Lessons learned from the Crux, fixed requirements and a new contractor made the project a success. Every project goal was met, and the result is a ship that has proven to be a tough nut to crack.",,,
oas_tusker,SHIP,"A large combat freighter with big guns. Tusker works as a auxiliary tanker and freighter, it has enough firepower to fight against other heavy cruisers, often coming out on top. Two large ballistic mounts with a wide firing arc and a single hardpoint Large missile mount facing forward, yet enough PD slots to protect it from rear attacks. It's a tough one to get at and the hull is preferred by many trade convoys as a leading ship. It's been shown that fleets with Tuskers are statistically less interrupted by pirate raids.",,,
oas_observer,SHIP,"A large, fast and a sleak hull, it's the first Osiris Alliance ship equipped with a large ORB (Osiris Radar Ball). Built to act as a command vessel along faster moving frigates and destroyers. Two large ballistic turret mounts give a wide firing arc to every direction. Plenty of missile power, along with the ORB's ECCM boost and fast speed make it a beast that hunts slower ships. It can easily fend of attackers by doing long range attacks with it's ORB's Targeting Assistant system before the enemy gets close enough to harm it. It has a single launch bay to provide small scale carrier capability.

For a period of time Observer captains did not come around the Alliance space, they were only allowed to do long range salvage and survey missions away from the core worlds. The ship class was succesfully held as a secret. Fueling and resupply arrangements were handled by the OA specops department. These secret logistic resupply operations kept the hull under the radar of the comsec world. Until it was too late for them to do anything about it without a full blown war. This battlecruiser is the reason why the Osiris Alliance managed to stay independent.",,,
oas_blaster_drone,SHIP,"A semi-autonomous mining shuttle equipped with a Mining Blaster and a small cargo bay to transport material back to the mothership. The pilots main task is to supervise the Mining Blaster, ensure it's not pointed at the wrong target. The second task is to handle the retrieval of possible valuables, after the Spitter has pulverized the target.",,,
oas_beetle,SHIP,"A heavy duty fighter meant to empty the surrounding space from other fighters. Dual vulcans, along with a shield penetrating railgun is enough firepower to bring down anything smaller than a frigate. Heavy armor ensures the Turtle survives the engagement.",,,
toopo_boomer,SHIP,"Named after every Spacer's favourite beverage unit due to a certain resemblance on how the weapon mounts look. Built upon the Phaeton-tanker hull, the tanks have been removed to make way for a umnatched weapon battery in the Destroyer sized ships. The broadside design has two medium energy and one missile mount on the port-side, and three ballistic mounts on the starboard-side. A 360 degree wide ballistic point defense mount system protects the hull from stray missiles. The Phaeton civilian-class systems have been replaced with militarized versions.",,,
toopo_bucket,SHIP,A combination of several civilian hull pieces bolted and welded together makes Butcher a cheap destroyer alternative. And a deadly surprise for bigger and slower targets. Carries a huge makeshift Dogleg antimatter torpedo made out of a Hound engine. Dogleg hit stop anything but the biggest ships on a direct hull hit. Two medium ballistic mounts give mediocre firepower advantage over frigates. Equipped with burn drive capable Tarsus engines. A capable pilot utilizes the burn drive and the Dogleg to bring down bigger fish.,,,
toopo_colosseum,SHIP,"If you want to field massive amounts of cheap fighter wings, on a cheap platform, Colosseum is a perfect ship. A colossus freighter has been cut in pieces and rearranged to support four fighter bays. Due to the makeshift design. Colosseum is unable to support a full capacity of higher quality fighters. It has a weak shield and only four small ballistic weapon slots to defend against the weakest attackers. Totally uncapable of standing in the line of battle. A damper field generator has been installed to give escorting ships time to help if Colosseum finds itself in a too tight spot.

Colosseum was a heavily used carrier by the Osiris Alliance during its early stages. The command structures put in place are designed for a carrier with the ability to send out four fighter squadrons. Colosseum dictated the way future carriers were specified and is the sole reason why captains wanted to stick with the four bay design.",,,
toopo_gemlasher,SHIP,"Gemcutter is a combination of Gemini-hull and parts of a Lasher frigate. Moves a lot faster for not having the modular Gemini cargo bay dragging it down. The front has been fortified with the lasher forward armor, alltough it's still not enough to make it considered as anything but a weakly armored destroyer. Lashers accelerated ammo feeder has been integrated giving the Gemcutter a surprise to anyone within a range of its guns.",,,
toopo_gallium,SHIP,"The Babylon hull is based on an old weapons test platform blueprint. It's known for its impressive caféteria's and restaurants keeping an army of engineers and scientists happy during test runs. Armor plates has been slapped around the weakest and most exposed bits to give it more survivability in engagements. The starboard side testbed houses a large energy mount. In front it has a makeshift large ballistic mount, and on the port side a large missile mount. There's also an old medium weapon testbed that has three universal weapon mounts. The Shield was made only to protect from the occasional hazards a civilian ship was specced to face and is not graded for combat. Suited to be the fleets first capital ship, but with its shortcomings you'll likely want to upgrade to a military grade battleship ASAP.",,,
toopo_dramster,SHIP,"Dramster is what happens to a Dram that can no longer hold it's fuel. The tanker has been cutted and rearranged and is a much lighter in mass. The Dram engines are quite powerful without the excess mass. It accelerates well and the some of the tanker pieces are used as armor. A makeshift EMP generator improves its utility for a fleet. A poor mans Omen, some say. It cannot take htis, it has a weak hull structure, combined with the weakest shield generator meaning it will quickly disintegrate under enemy fire. Especially if you find yourself in front of anything larger than a frigate.",,,
toopo_apoture,SHIP,"An answer to the prayers for salvage captains whose requirements include a launch bay. The best selling survey hull trough cycles 203 to 205, even the upcoming cycle 206 looks like it's still the best seller in its class. Apparatus is the epitome of the Power Jinx R&D's blueprint hacking prowess, equipped with a deadly array of missile mounts, Large Energy mount and the power and shield system from Apogee. This ship can kick and eat jabs with it's mighty 360 degree shield. A favourite of the lone captains and a common sight in survey fleets.",,,
toopo_xplorer,SHIP,"An incredible feat of datamining and blueprint hacking. Multiple different sources were connected and mixed in a controlled way to achieve the resulting hull design. Mutant was an instant success in the survey hull market. A very modular weapon design that allows it to work in multiple different fleet designations. One of the strongest frontal shields in the sector thanks to a technology only seen in the more higher tech military ships. It can hold it's position in battle in a tigh line longer than most ships, the manuevering engines provide it with fast turning speed. Its biggest weakness is against multiple flanking ships, you can only point the shield at one of them.",,,
toopo_miningboi,SHIP,"Radiator is an old mining frigate, originally made as an competitor to the Shepherd drone tender. It never beat Shepherd in reviews as it was hard to beat the accurate drones in mining purposes. Radiator was made to wield a large blaster that just obliterates asteroids, and the crew was supposed to handle the ore retrieval with heavy machinery. This requirement of having more spacers that had be paid monthly wages, was ultimately the reason for its commercial failure. The original blueprint was datamined and updated by Power Jinx R&D to wield any kind of energy weapon on its front. It lacks a modern shield, but has a damper device to protect itself from detonated asteroid pieces, or weapon fire if you find yourself in the wrong place.",,,
toopo_trooperboi,SHIP,"This version of the Radiator has been modified to transfer troops. Power Jinx R&D claims it's painted with an ancient camouflage that'll make you invisible in terran environment. Most of the complicated energy systems have been removed and replaced with a life supporte system to support new cramped living quarters. A fast troop deploy gate system now stands in stead of the usual frontal energy mount. Its weapon mount arrangement has been totally changed to fit a more flux friendly ballistic system and the sensor apparatus has been removed to make room for a missile mount.

oas_hml,WEAPON,"This is a big Laser meant to cut ship hulls and asteroids into pieces. A proprietary, special purpose liquid hydrogen cooling system is a required to mount the laser. A special certification process must be met by the ship hull, and a high cost course must be passed by the crew members whose job is to maintain the system. This stopped adoption for the tool quickly and the design decisions caused careers to end prematurely. Rumor has it that the laser never hit the required proft margins it was meant to.",,,
oas_s_cannon,WEAPON,"The mathematics of superconductive Magnetron projectiles tell us that smaller projectiles allow for exponentially more of them to be fired within a timeframe. Two barrels even the flux flow from the chemical combustions. Most of the flux generated by the payload accelerator system goes out along with the projectile, making this version of the Magnetron Cannon very flux efficient.",,,
oas_s_pd,WEAPON,A point defense ballistic weapon with ammunition buffering system enabling quick bursts towards incoming missiles and fighters. Continuous firing causes the barrels thermal protection systems to kick in  resulting in a more spray and pray type of weapon. A deadly weapon in the right hands.,,,
oas_m_cannon,WEAPON,A medium version of the Magnetron Cannon. Causes hard damage to shields thanks to the fast spinning kinetic payload. Not the most efficient weapon to penetrate hulls but incredible tool against shields.,,,
oas_m_blazer,WEAPON,"Two thermal shapers transform molten mass into a wide, thin arc of plasma that gets propelled forward by controlled combustion. Upon hitting hull, the plasma arc cuts trough matter like butter. The massive thermal flux that roams inside the thermal shaper make the resulting projectile trajectory hard to predict, making accurate corrections to the recoil impossible by common means resulting in a below average accuracy.",,,
oas_m_pd,WEAPON,"A double barreled version of the Star Sprayer point defense weapon system. Saturates the space around any ship with fast moving projectiles, seemingly creating a ballistic shield that can't be penetrated by missiles. A thought quickly forgotten when a missile eventually manages to get past the projectiles.",,,
oas_xlcannon,WEAPON,"A heavy projectile is propelled by chemical combustion. A large coil system activates hundreds of smaller projectiles inside the primary shell to spin around in a superconductive magnetic railing system. The magnetic field measures upto 100 Tesla, causing a glowing red plasma around the projectile in the vacuum of space. Upon impact, the shell ruptures and the magnetic system ceases to exist, freeing the fast moving matter. This unleashes immensive kinetic energy to whatever it hits.",,,
oas_xl_blazer,WEAPON,Voted as the most efficient pirate repellant around the Persean system. The large shaped plasma arcs destroy the will of any opposing force that dares to come close enough. There's not a single spacer who would willingly would want to see a thin plasma arc cut trough their crewmates.,,,
oas_trident_large,WEAPON,"The ultimate long range missile system. A single launch sends three Trident missiles towards the target ship. A trident missile has three Harpoon missiles inside. Once a Trident missile gets close enough, it breaks apart and unleashes the three harpoon missiles, a total of 9 harpoons. The missiles are usually used as a finisher, or as a battle initializer and finalizer.",,,

osiris,FACTION,"Named after the legendary salvage captain Osiris Sun. The Osiris Alliance is ruled by a board of directors. Any corporate entity that has enough credits can buy their seat on the table. Against the original spirit of the Alliance, this fee seems to steadily raise. The Osiris Alliance is the entity responsible for the governing and military security of few planets who make up the alliance. Before the independency declaration its main responsibility was to fight against pirates, during the AI wars it protected civilian populations as best as it could. After the declaration of free enterprise and independency, protection against possible invasions by other factions became the new focus for the Osiris Alliance military.

The Alliance was born with the idealogy of free enterprise. Anyone is free to join their world and start building their own enterprises. This has made the Alliance worlds gain a steady flow of people from the core Persean systems. The planets are full of Domain technology, ripe to be picked up and used again. Surprisingly, completely new technology have started to emerge from the ashes due to the free capitalistic system.
