oas_pullet,SHIP,"The thankless job of a freighter captain amidst a war fleet is a tiny bit easier aboard this heavily armed freighter class. The Pullet is a cheap, long-forgotten domain freighter design that lost its job to better alternatives during the more peaceful times. The simple frame hull is easily reconfigured to militaristic needs by able hands.

The blueprint was not readily available around the Persean sector after the collapse. The hull blueprint resurfaced from the tech mines of the Osiris Alliance.",,,
oas_raccoon,SHIP,This lightweight attack frigate can act as a decoy against larger vessels. Anyone not respecting Raccoon enough will find pieces missing from the aft. A good battle plan should reduce 1-on-1 brawls as it's one environment where Raccoon is lacking. Extended deployments lower the statistical chance of survival.,,,
oas_narwhal,SHIP,"Sibling design of the Unicorn-class, Narwhal is a much cheaper and simpler tool, built mainly to haul cargo during less peaceful times. It is a legacy tool that has found a fit for the current climate. A desperate fleet captain can turn it into a serviceable attack vessel.

The blueprint was not readily available around the Persean sector after the collapse. The hull blueprint resurfaced from the tech mines of the Osiris Alliance.",,,
oas_basalt,SHIP,"A mighty, less-known cruiser-sized freighter, the Basalt brings an impressive logistical capability to a fleet. It comes with a surprising amount of weapon mounts for a heavy freighter and seems capable of using them if needed.

The blueprint was not readily available around the Persean sector after the collapse. The hull blueprint resurfaced from the tech mines of the Osiris Alliance.",,,
oas_marten,SHIP,"A phase missile striker, this class wields earlier phase coil design more akin to the old phase prototypes. The logistic capability of the ship is a clear sign of how the earlier phase ships were still searching for their purpose. Much like Gremlin-class, Marten-class ships are far from a favorite designation for any crew member.",,,
toopo_fallen_eagle,SHIP,"An eagle with its wings cut off. Modified to terrifying lengths, this is a much faster and deadlier version of the standard Eagle class ship. The modifications made by the pirates seem complex, and this ship must be one-of-a-kind.",,,
toopo_solace,SHIP,Solace-class was the secret of the Domain administrators meant to protect the Domain against rebellious Onslaught captains. Solace is a faster capital ship equipped with a laser array able to penetrate the thickest of armors. How this very rare blueprint found its way to the Persean sector is a mystery.,,,
toopo_merc_cerb,SHIP,This ship looks like a baffling wonder built on top of what seems to be a Cerberus-class hull. Everything seems to be unique and custom-made to fit together. The ship must've cost a fortune considering the technology. The top minds of the Persean sector must have had their hands on it.,,,
toopo_blockman,SHIP,"From its blocky first appearance, Blockman-class looks like a sturdy freighter. Instead, you get a light combat cruiser that can act its name and cut the opposition into chunks of meat, albeit more slowly than usual. Blockman is a defensive powerhouse that will outlast rather than outgun the enemy.",,,
oas_hexagon,SHIP,The Hexagon class is a mining station turned into a fully-fledged carrier/battleship. The original intent was to provide mining companies with a mobile base of operations as they traveled and moved along asteroid belts. The massive cargo bay can fit a ton of loot and supplies. The class is an excellent option for anyone wanting to spend time salvaging and exploring the outer edges of the sector. Or for destroying the local competition.,,,
oas_spectator,SHIP,"Unusually fragile and agile destroyer for the alliance, the Spectator can be best described as a glass cannon. The Spectator can control the spacing and range of the battle. It is a valuable tool for any fleet wanting to go toe to toe against more mobile force.",,,
toopo_murderer,SHIP,It is only known as the Slayer-class carrier. Its origin remains a mystery. Its history seems to have evaporated during the collapse. The only thing remaining is the actual ship and its blueprint. Slayer is a sturdy carrier with enough ballistic mounts to brawl in melee. An aggressive follow-up after a wave of fighters or bombers brings most enemies to their knees.,,,
oas_magma,SHIP,"Rarely can you find such a pure vessel of war as the Magma-class cruiser. The class is a heavily armored military version of the Basalt Heavy Freighter hull. The big cargo hull got replaced with troop quarters and larger weapon mounts. It can act in the dual role of artillery/troop transport platform. After bounding the enemy with its weapon artillery, it can deploy a company full of marines with supporting equipment in atmospheric conditions. The slow hunk of armor can rarely survive engagements solo and tend to require escorting craft so the fleet can fully benefit from its immense firepower.",,,
oas_calmella,SHIP,"This class seems like a tanker disguised as a combat frigate. Calmella can carry a Dram's worth of antimatter fuel while carrying a deadly surprise for anyone daring to meddle with it. Antimatter weaponry is built-in straight into the hull, fueled directly from the tanks.",,,
oas_blaster,SHIP,"A warship-looking mining tool. The look is a marketing gimmick to let anyone captaining the Blaster think they are a warship captain. Surprisingly though, it does make for a great warship. Blaster has an ample power core capable of running numerous weapon mounts found in most post-collapse setups of the ship.",,,
oas_wayfarer2,SHIP,"One of the primary reasons why the alliance is still independent of the Hegemony. Wombat has a rare frigate size nanoforge, able to create a wing from most LPCs. Destroyer level armor in addition to composite mounts make Wombat one tough nut to crack. The ship can be used in many roles, from acting as command ship in fast a moving wolfpack, to a piece in a large scale defence formation.",,,
oas_opossum,SHIP,"A sibling of the Wombat carrier, Opossum is more of a logistical solution to a small fleet. The class is primarily a maintenance vessel for other ships, carrying supplies and doing maintenance duties in a fleet. The small drone bay hosts a wing of Bob-class arcwelding drones. The drones have had their arcwelders overcharged for combat use, making them able to zap things from far away. Opossum tends to stay alive better if its drones are up and running. Without the drones Opossum becomes a sitting duck, only able to defend against weaker opponents.",,,
oas_polecat,SHIP,"The constant threat of Hegemony Armadas called for a doctrine to negate the threat. Polecat is one of the special units of the Osiris Alliance to keep any large warships constantly on their toes. Polecat is a fast torpedo boat that can break through the escorts with enough agility to launch their missile payloads, usually armed with a dogleg torpedo. Outside of the potential war scenario against Hegemony, Polecat works mainly with wolfpack patrols as a supporting missile platform.",,,
oas_scissor,SHIP,"Scissor holds the title of being one of the fastest ships in its class, making it an excellent interceptor. 360-degree bubble shield and a flare launcher protect the ship, but it lacks point defense mounts. A single hardpoint centers the ship's design, and a unique turbo system enhances anything put onto it. Used at anything but in offense means a total mischaracterization.",,,
oas_lightdestro,SHIP,"Scanner-class is an odd duck amongst all the slow hulks of Osiris Alliance. Most of the peacetime duties of the Alliance's fleet are patrolling the neighborhood. Catching smugglers and pirates is a job that requires two very distinct abilities. The first is to find these fleets; the second is to chase them. Scanner excels in both. While its firepower cannot punch up as much as some other Destroyer class hulls, it should not struggle against smaller craft. In larger-scale combat it can easily move around, helping where needed.",,,
oas_butcher,SHIP,"Being an earlier Power Jinx R&D design, Butcher became so widespread that the Alliance finally figured out a way to better it. Long gone are the burn drive, replaced with fast missile racks. Upgraded armor and power system allow it to act as a sturdy, dangerous piece in a fleet setting, becoming an even more robust missile platform than the original version. It doubles down as a cheap all-around ship, deployable in almost any situation. The low running price tag made the hull especially appreciated in the Acquisitions Department.",,,
oas_lg_drone,SHIP,"The Bob arc welder drone system was an excellent tool for any fleet maintenance officer. They were the best friend of a captain with a broken hull. After the gates collapsed, the harsh reality of anarchy forced most captains to overcharge the welder, turning it into a weapon system. No longer can you expect healing from Bob, only destruction.",,,
oas_nutcracker,SHIP,A legacy fighter chassis that was already obsolete before the collapse of the gate system. The only good thing going for the fighter is that it is cheap.,,,
oas_blaster_drone2,SHIP,"A multipurpose mining laser, a blaster, and an energy shield make Spitter a high-end mining drone. It is remote-commanded - not directly controlled - from within the safety of the mothership. The multiple ways it can cut and blast asteroids into dust work well against other ships in combat scenarios.",,,
oas_blaster_drone3,SHIP,"Re-purposed and re-equipped Spitter drone platform contains the newest blaster and burst laser weaponry, worthy of a new hull designation Spitter Mk. II. It is remote-commanded - not directly controlled - from within the safety of the mothership. The militarized command & control package comes with enough data transmission overhead that the wing size has been reduced to three to stay within the designated transmission ranges.",,,
oas_starburst,SHIP,"Starburst is a capable interceptor fighter hull, diseased with an underperforming main gun. It even has a decoy flare,  bringing you about the same tactical advantage as deploying a wing of Talons. The official OA manual for commanding officers refers, quite politically, to the Starburst as a nuisance to opposing forces.",,,
oas_bowler,SHIP,"A Catamaran hull design was necessary to support the massive Ballburst cannon on a fighter-sized platform. Bowler is a robust and well-armored fighter brawler, dominating lesser vehicles by its presence alone. It can loiter around bigger ships by deploying decoys to keep the point defense weaponry busy. A pair of reloading Matchstick torpedo tubes increase its effectiveness against bare armor.",,,
oas_fisher,SHIP,"Teach a man to fish, and he will never run out of food. Employ the Fisher in combat, and you will have no trouble with enemy shields. Many things had to go correct to get the design inside a Limited Production Chip. Osiris Alliance ran a widescale trade espionage and blackmail campaign to get the Fisher into production.",,,
oas_retinator,SHIP,"Retinator is effectively a kinetic missile equipped with self-defense weaponry. An onboard Retinator Computer Core is combined with the smallest ORB device in the Osiris Alliance inventory, calculating ballistic trajectories for the Star Sprayer PD gun. The hull hides a full-fledged Snapper missile core, waiting to be sacrificed at the master ship's will.",,,
oas_skull,SHIP,"A very strong destroyer mainly employed by the AMEG. It can surprise enemy fleets with its time-dilation system.",,,
toopo_bucket2,SHIP,"The ship seems to be stronger than other hulls of its size. It appears to be a prototype design variant and is most likely worth taking a second looking. Perhaps advanced is not the word to use along the ship modifications done to a Butcher-hull. The arms look extended and house an additional pair of small caliber mounts. Gone are the bulky medium hardpoints and in place of them are two turrets, giving a wider targeting arc for the main arsenal.",,,
toopo_cutie,SHIP,"Long ago, when phase technology was in its infancy, a company decided to pre-emptively design a functional deterrent against possible phase attacks against the Domain armadas. Resonator-class can overload any ship within range, phased or not, giving it a surprising angle of attack against an unsuspecting phase ship. The ship never saw daylight, as the top secret facility it was developed in disappeared in what appears to be one of the first targeted phase fleet attacks.",,,
toopo_oscillator,SHIP,"For the captain who looks for comfort and safety, an Oscillator-class destroyer is a good second after a comfy pillow. Top Domain-era shield technology combined with a powerful generator makes surviving any attack a breeze. It was originally designed as a survey ship, much like the more common Apogee-class. It is still a prime candidate for the designation, but in the current climate of the sector a destroyer that can tank damage is a godsend for any fleet.",,,
toopo_scorpion,SHIP,An abomination of a carrier. Small-scale pirate fleets in the sector use Scorpion as a moving command post. A fan favorite for the hard-working pirate warlord on the move. Frigate parties go raiding and return full of loot within the safety of the defensive embrace of the carrier. It is a troublesome beast for the weaker patrols policing peaceful polities around the sector. A properly planned attack party is needed to take down the station. A sure way for an attacker to go down is to forget the Scorpion's stinger.,,,
toopo_genesis,SHIP,"Of the Domain Naval capitals, Genesis is a rare ship to appear around any populated system, built mainly to patrol alone in the dark outskirts of the known Domain space. Genesis' design was not to be a member of any armada but to control the outer skirts of the Domain space, outside the reach of the massive battlegroups. A Genesis captain only had a minimum supporting fleet, and any threat to the Domain authority required a swift response before escalating into an unbearable situation. It is best to fit Genesis with alpha strike weapons while keeping it away from the more formal battle lines.",,,
oas_viper,SHIP,"Muskrat is a voluminous tube with large fuel tanks and cargo hold. The armor casing works well as a scanning blocker, making Muskrat a common sight in the hands of smugglers. Built with the same principles and requirements as the Rhino, it provides security and logistical capabilities for smaller fleets. It has surprisingly good armor and large mounts for a frigate, making it a perfect line breaker against frigate lines. The integrated ballistic drive makes for a nasty surprise during the first contact of a fight.",,,
oas_gazer,SHIP,"A heavily armored cruiser, Gazer packs a lot of missile power and can act as a finisher in a fleet setting. A powerful Retinator wing acts as its point defense guard, allowing Gazer to carry mainly an offensive weapons loadout. The power generation side is lacking, making controlling flux levels a crucial step to gaining any success in combat. Hits to the hull can save energy and lessen the burden on the flux capacitors, allowing Gazers ORB to unleash its gaze in the form of a powerful laser.",,,
oas_hen,SHIP,"A captain that cares about style will dismiss the Hen-class ship as an ugly duckling. An experienced one will realize the alpha strike potential offered. Looking like a fat freighter from the outside gives a false impression as it houses a frigate-sized Missile Autoforge. Well armored and agile enough to meddle amongst the largest ships. Hen-class can saturate the space with missiles and overpower larger hulls if they do not respect the Hen. You'll often encounter Hen as an escort for bigger ships, waiting to unleash a missile salvo to turn the tide of the battle.",,,
oas_sun,SHIP,"A stalwart of the Alliance, Sun bears the name Osiris Sun, the local folk hero. COMSEC officials have not been able to determine the origin of this hull, and speculations are running wild around the sector where it came. The first appearance happened during the second AI war, defending the alliance population centers against rampaging AI fleets. Sun has a free-floating ORB device, producing telemetry and advanced targeting info that it can share with other fleet members.",,,
oas_rhino2,SHIP,"A ship designed to protect trade convoys. Rhino is based on the Unicorn hull, the legendary domain design favoured by many salvage captains. More armor was built around the already sturdy hull. The large mining laser was changed to fit any large ballistic cannon, additional PD mounts were added on the starboard side. The built-in shuttle bay was modified to support modular LPC's. While the Rhino can't match the speed of other hulls in its class, it can outgun and surprise them with the ballistic drive system. Its voluminous hull embodies incredible logistic capabilities and the ship is often used as a logistic ship in military fleets. Rhino is self-sufficient during longer voyages and it has the ability to send a fighter wing to escort weaker ships.

Due to simple derivative additions on top of the widespread Unicorn hull, Osiris Alliance could not keep the blueprints secret and the design has spread through every corner of the Persian system. Everyone likes a sturdy Rhino in their fleet.",,,
oas_owl,SHIP,"A new generation design based on feedback from Lasher Mk. II pilots. The largest drawback was the lack of point defense capabilities. This was fixed by adding a 360-degree ballistic mount for PD weapons. It made the hull bulky, and the design went through numerous iterations until it was no longer reminiscent of the original Lasher Mk II hit'n'run concept. It turned out into a more refined and powerful Scanner class heavy frigate, with an impressive array of frontal facing turret hardpoints. It's equipped with four small ballistic mounts, a medium missile slot to provide a finishing capability that was missing in Lasher Mk II. It has a smaller version of the ORB(Osiris Radar Ball), tuned to provide brief laser bursts that can easily cut through smaller hulls. The firepower and ORB make it a favoured patrol ship. Smugglers have a grown a special hatred towards the Scanner.",,,
oas_eraser,SHIP,"This class reeks of power and speed. A great set of weapons bolted onto a pair of powerful engines makes Eraser one of the premier battle skirmishers. When captained by the best pilots, combat performance tends to soar upwards.",,,
toopo_eraser,SHIP,"This class reeks of power and speed. A great set of weapons bolted onto a pair of powerful engines makes Eraser one of the premier battle skirmishers. When captained by the best pilots, combat performance tends to soar upwards.",,,
oas_airo,SHIP,"A high-tech frigate holds an impressive weapon mount arrangement, immense firepower capabilities for its size, with flux capacity to match. AMEG X-Axis Time Dilator ship system is the Ribcage's most imposing weapon. It can catch anything using the time dilation capability that makes it seemingly travel faster than anything else in a straight line. The technology works without the magic of p-space phasing. However, aboard the vessel, the crew grows old quicker, and battles last longer.

No one truly knows where the blueprint came. Antimatter Energy Group holds an energy monopoly on the fastest-growing planet in the sector, which has its perks. Seemingly unlimited credits can hasten the spawn of unique hull designs from the vast tech ruins. Rumors of a lucky salvage crew vanishing after a big tech find are associated with the appearance of these ships. A fact that is spread only in the smaller, more independent news stations.",,,
oas_airo_oa,SHIP,"After multiple heated conversations within the Osiris Alliance board of directors, accusations of gatekeeping the military from advanced weaponry, the Antimatter Energy Group budged and allowed a more heavily armored ballistic version of the AMEG Ribcage to be put in production. The internal delicate machinery components were removed to fit a more simplified ballistic drive system. It is much more cost-friendly to manufacture and maintain for the alliance's military organization. The modifications come at a cost to the flux capability and top speed.

No one truly knows where the blueprint came. Antimatter Energy Group holds an energy monopoly on the fastest-growing planet in the sector, which has its perks. Seemingly unlimited credits can hasten the spawn of unique hull designs from the vast tech ruins. Rumors of a lucky salvage crew vanishing after a big tech find are associated with the appearance of these ships. A fact that is spread only in the smaller, more independent news stations.",,,
oas_purjo,SHIP,"This weird-looking destroyer has the capability to turn tides of any battle. Equipped with a fully integrated AMEG Time Dilator, it can dilate time around it to travel quickly in any direction. At least it appears so to the outside world while the crew inside the bubble gets bored at the slowly moving time. Equipped with enough medium energy mounts to make bigger cruisers look under-armed. Even a newbie captain can deliver deadly alpha strikes and escape without a scratch commanding this vessel.

No one truly knows where this blueprint came from. Holding an energy monopoly on the fastest-growing planet in the sector has its perks. Seemingly limitless credits can apparently hasten the spawn of a unique hull design from the vast tech ruins. Rumours of a lucky salvage crew vanishing after a big tech find have always been associated with the Antimatter Energy Group vessels appearing. The timing of the salvage crew vanishing and these hull designs appearing on the Orbital Works job queues matches according to public open news channels.",,,
oas_flabellina,SHIP,"Unlike other tankers. Flabellina shoots back. Two antimatter pulse blasters are directly fed by the Antimatter tanks. Short ranged weapons, but it's not a problem for the captain as they can burn drive to deliver the total annihilation for any enemy. However, the big fuel tanks make it clumsy and hard to control in fast-paced combat. It is truly best left to do the duty of a tanker, only to be used as a support vessel in combat.",,,
oas_igniter,SHIP,"A low-cost metallic tube filled with two Matchstick torpedos and a powerful engine makes Igniter a trustworthy bomber platform against weaker stationary targets lacking in point defense capabilities.

The user manual comes with precalculated cost efficiency reference tables, showing the expected ratio of the crew and material losses per the difficulty of engagement.",,,
oas_lolslaught,SHIP,"A nightmare, in every possible way. You can't but imagine what could have created this behemoth version of the Onslaught hull. You are not surprised when you find marks of Antimatter Energy Group around the ship hull. This Onslaught must have been a cruel joke by whoever created it. The rumors of a possible AI meddling with the design make sense when you look at this monster.",,,
oas_unicorn,SHIP,"Every explorer's wet dream, unless they are rich enough to buy an apogee. A rare sight in the core systems as it is regarded mainly for long-range exploration and salvage missions. Unicorn comes equipped with a wing of Spitter-class mining drones and a proprietary mining laser. Humane working conditions and human maintainable systems have made this ship a favored job designation by spacers. The ship-class is named after the mythical creature unicorn, as the laser in front reminds spacers of a unicorn's alicorn.",,,
oas_unicorn2,SHIP,"The ship seems to be stronger than other hulls of its size. It appears to be a prototype design variant and is most likely worth taking a second looking. Unicorn Mk. II comes equipped with a wing of Spitter Mk. II-class blaster drones and an upgraded set of energy mounts compared to the original Unicorn design. The power generator appears to contain a much more powerful version of the original, rigged with a professional set of new-looking power equipment, most likely from the top selection of Tri-Tachyon's catalog.",,,
oas_saltire,SHIP,"A modern carrier with enough armor to make it do the work of a frontline battleship if the need arises. It has an impressive frontal ballistic battery for a dedicated carrier platform. A wide array of ballistic mountings, with a plethora of launch bays, gives it an ability few ships possess. Saltire can simultaneously strike with bombers, fighters, and artillery.",,,
oas_tusker2,SHIP,"The one true workhorse of any fleet, Tusker works in many roles, be it combat freighter, carrier, or mauler. A common sight amongst all the Osiris Alliance fleets, protecting and leading larger trade convoys. While Tusker is a jack of all trades, it's heavily influenced by how its weapons and launch bays get fitted. Its slow speed gets mitigated by the capital class armor, making it a hated sight amongst the pirates in the sector who tend to lack the tools to penetrate it.",,,
oas_observer,SHIP,"As the primary everyday battlecarrier of the alliance, Observer-class commands the battlefield with the aid of its ORB (Osiris Radar Ball) device, having a perfect vision of what's happening on the field. Heavily armored like any other alliance ship, it can take a pounding and trade blows with other capital ships as long as it abuses its range. Anything smaller is prey and quickly overrun by its combination of fighter wings, weapons, and the ORB power laser.",,,
oas_phasey,SHIP,"A pure special operations ship that is capable of operating deep within enemy territory. Panther-class can carry out marine ground attacks, deliver tactical bombardments and handle secret logistic operations and surprise attacks.

Panther is not designed for direct battle, the two medium ballistic hardpoints it has are mainly for self-defense against smaller vessels. The preferred battle routine is to quickly deliver all the explosive ordnance it has and leave the battlefield ASAP.

A Unicorn-class hull was selected to work as the base for its familiarity along with the Alliance forces. Two modernized gremlin phase coils were slotted on the hull design, with the aid of few bribed Tritachyon employees. Angled surfaces and hidden weapon bays in addition to the phase technology let it operate with a very small radar signature.

The unique array of capabilities enabled the Osiris Alliance to develop the power it has now. Many of the Hegemony response fleets sent after the declaration of independence had weird catastrophic logistic supply failures. Newest data leaks have revealed that these failures were caused by Panther fleets.",,,
oas_blaster_drone,SHIP,"A semi-autonomous mining shuttle equipped with a Mining Blaster and a small cargo bay to transport material back to the mothership. The pilot's main task is to supervise the Mining Blaster, ensure it's not pointed at the wrong target. The second task is to handle the retrieval of possible valuables after the Spitter has pulverized the target.",,,
oas_turtle2,SHIP,"A heavy-duty fighter meant to empty the surrounding space from other fighters. Dual Star Sprayers, along with a shield penetrating Magnetron cannon is enough firepower to bring down anything smaller than a frigate. Heavy armor ensures the Turtle survives the engagement.",,,
toopo_bucket,SHIP,A combination of several civilian hull pieces bolted and welded together make Butcher a cheap destroyer alternative. And a deadly surprise for bigger and slower targets. Carries a huge makeshift Dogleg antimatter torpedo made out of a Hound engine. Dogleg hit stop anything but the biggest ships on a direct hull hit. Two medium ballistic mounts give mediocre firepower advantage over frigates. Equipped with burn drive capable Tarsus engines. A capable pilot utilizes the burn drive and the Dogleg to bring down bigger fish.,,,
toopo_colosseum,SHIP,"If you want to field massive amounts of cheap fighter wings, on a cheap platform, Colosseum is a perfect ship. A colossus freighter has been cut in pieces and rearranged to support four fighter bays. Due to the makeshift design. Colosseum is unable to support a full capacity of higher quality fighters. It has a weak shield and only four small ballistic weapon slots to defend against the weakest attackers. It is incapable of standing in the line of battle. A damper field generator has been installed to give escorting ships time to help if Colosseum finds itself in a too-tight spot.

Colosseum was a heavily used carrier by the Osiris Alliance during its early stages. The command structures put in place are designed for a carrier with the ability to carry out four fighter squadrons. Colosseum dictated the way future carriers are specified, and it is the sole reason why captains wanted to stick with the four-bay design.",,,
toopo_dramster,SHIP,"Dramster is a conversion of a Dram with its notable fuel tanks removed. It has been cut, rearranged, and reassembled and the result of this process is this light frigate. As Dram's engines are quite powerful, Dramster is quite fast and doesn't lose its speed even with some additional armor plating attached. Some say it is a poor man's Omen, due to a makeshift EMP emitter being installed. Still, as this vessel is an amalgamation of Dram parts, it cannot take hits and disintegrates under enemy fire quickly. Especially if it is forced to fight anything bigger than itself.",,,
toopo_apoture,SHIP,"An answer to the prayers for salvage captains whose requirements include a launch bay. The best-selling survey hull through cycles 203 to 205, even the upcoming cycle 206 looks like it's still the best seller in its class. Apparatus is the epitome of the Power Jinx R&D's blueprint hacking prowess, equipped with a deadly array of missile mounts, a Large Energy mount, and the power and shield system from Apogee. This ship can kick and eat jabs with its mighty 360-degree shield. A favourite of the lone captains and a common sight in survey fleets.",,,
toopo_xplorer,SHIP,"An incredible feat of data mining and blueprint hacking. Multiple different sources were connected and mixed in a controlled way to achieve the resulting hull design. Mutant was an instant success in the survey hull market. A very modular weapon design that allows it to work in multiple different fleet designations. One of the strongest frontal shields in the sector thanks to a technology only seen in the more higher-tech military ships. It can hold its position in battle in a tight line longer than most ships, the maneuvering engines provide it with fast turning speed. Its biggest weakness is against multiple flanking ships, you can only point the shield at one of them.",,,
toopo_miningboi,SHIP,"Radiator is an old mining frigate, originally made as a competitor to the Shepherd drone tender. It never beat Shepherd in reviews as it was hard to beat the accurate drones for mining purposes. Radiator was made to wield a large blaster that just obliterates asteroids, and the crew was supposed to handle the ore retrieval with heavy machinery. This requirement of having more spacers that had to be paid monthly wages was ultimately the reason for its commercial failure. The original blueprint was datamined and updated by Power Jinx R&D to wield any kind of energy weapon on its front. It lacks a modern shield, but has a damper device to protect itself from detonated asteroid pieces, or weapon fire if you find yourself in the wrong place.",,,
toopo_trooperboi,SHIP,"This version of the Radiator has been modified to transfer troops. Power Jinx R&D claims it's painted with an ancient camouflage that'll make you invisible in a Terran environment. Most of the complicated energy systems have been removed and replaced with a life support system to support new cramped living quarters. A fast troop deploy gate system now stands instead of the usual frontal energy mount. Its weapon mount arrangement has been changed to fit a more flux-friendly ballistic system and the sensor apparatus has been removed to make room for a missile mount.

It lacks a modern shield, but has a damper device to protect itself from detonated asteroid pieces, or weapon fire if you find yourself in the wrong place.",,,
toopo_ecuador,SHIP,"A new, better Condor now in light cruiser size. The hull has gone through a full round of improvements. A heavy-duty capacitator system resides in the roomier hull, enabling much larger weapon mounts, and an additional set of armor plates give it the much-needed protection. It's now a full-blown battleship, able to guard a wider surrounding area with a combination of weapons and fighters.

The odd name comes from an ageless multimedia art piece, still loudly performed from time to time in certain spacer circles. There is a legend that this piece of art originated from the mythical planet Earth. The meaning of the word Ecuador is lost, but the word has persisted through ages along with the song.",,,
toopo_egg,SHIP,"Egg-class heavy frigates are a popular new addition to any military fleet. While they are suited to hold a line formation along with the bigger ships, you will gain more return to your investment by letting them roam the flanks as they are a speedier alternative to provide constant pressure on the enemy formation.

In battle, it acts much akin to the larger Eagle-class. The Egg tries to control the distance and to provide constant pressure with its numerous forward-facing mounts, a mix of small ballistic hardpoints, and energy turrets. The Egg can maintain its preferred distance, and if needed retreat unscathed, with its maneuvering jets.

While the hull is considered to be on the heavier frigate size. It will be outmatched by bigger vessels if you stay in range, and it cannot handle any amount of strike craft.

The blueprint is of older Domain design, and the Egg's use in an actual battle has been questioned. One of the theories is that it was a part of a large collection of design prototypes that tried to ride on the popularity of Eagle-class cruiser, a hull that was never mass-produced. Somehow the blueprint has resurfaced and it's now marketed as a fully functional warship.",,,
toopo_haast,SHIP,"The long-lost Haast-class Battleship blueprint has found its way back to the Persean sector. An old Domain design that was never as popular as the other larger battleships of its day. It was originally part of a prototype fleet design, acting as the fleet's capital. The fleet rode on the popular Eagle design, but the non-cruiser-sized Eagle style models never caught the eye of a wider audience.

Best, and maybe the worst part of the design is that it has to be used in the same manner as the Eagle-class cruiser. Holding a line and perfect distance for its huge array of energy weapons to slowly chew out the opposing force. The large armor surface negates some of its ability to dissipate flux as efficiently as its weaponry might require. The lack of proper dissipation decreases the chances of using the full-frontal ballistic battery. Using it at the wrong time might cause an accidental overload.",,,
toopo_clown,SHIP,"Clown is a sturdy light cruiser. A slow, well-armored and armed wedge that will gladly stand in the way of damage. Not speedy by any means, and will easily crawl behind faster ships and miss the first exchange of blows. The usual designation is as a line cruiser, while it is not as mobile as the famed Eagle and Falcon, it is protected by a damper field system. It fills a niche between a Dominator and Enforcer.",,,
toopo_tsunami,SHIP,"Each Tsunami comes with an additional module. The modules can range from logistic solutions to different combat modules. The main module contains an impressive array of weapon mounts, while the engines are fitted with a Plasma Burn device to help the ship move quickly around the battlefield. Tsunami-class ships house the most modern versions of highly automated ship maintenance systems in the Persean sector.
