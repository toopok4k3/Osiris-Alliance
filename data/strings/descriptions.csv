oas_wayfarer2,SHIP,The classic heavy frigate turned into a carrier by the Osiris Alliance. It took no time for the blueprint to spread troughout the system. Losing the frontal turrets was quickly forgotten by captains after they see the first fighter squadron obliterate unsuspecting enemies. This carrier modification has proved its viability in combat many times.,,,
oas_viper,SHIP,"Viper is a voluminous tube with large fuel tanks and cargo hold. The armor casing on top of the hull works as a blocker for scanning, making Viper a common sight for smugglers. Built with the same principles and requirements as Rhino to provide security and logistical capabilities. It has surprisingly large mounts for a frigate, but lacks in smaller mounts. It's a perfect line defense against pirate raiders. Any ship that comes close receives a storm of projectiles fed by the ammunition feeder ship system.",,,
oas_crux,SHIP,"A fast cruiser carrier hull. It has enough armament to punch against any frigate that tries to catch it. The original contract requirements from the alliance included 4 working launch bays. The winning design worked on paper and won the bid. The ship works, but it does not match the design specs and numerous adaptations have been implemented to make it fly. The reality struck in actual testing of the design. The internal pathways could only support three wings. One of the most obvious glitches is the fact that the commanders sleeping punk gets too hot as flux vent runs right behind a thin wall.",,,
oas_gazer,SHIP,"A third generation Osiris Alliance design. Gazer was made to project power anywhere on the battlefield. It can do quick surgical strikes on demand, from far away. This is enabled by a medium size ORB (Osiris Radar Ball) technology boosting the ships sensors and battlefield awareness. ""You can't hide from the gaze"" is a regurarly heard phrase among the pirates of Kanta's Den.",,,
oas_hen,SHIP,"A captain that cares about style will easily dismiss the Hen as an ugly duckling. An experienced one will realise the alpha strike potential offered. Agile enough to meddle with other frigates, Hen can sature the space with missiles and overpower larger ships if they are not careful. You'll often encounter Hen as an escort for larger class ships. Hen can't stand in the way of fire too long. But it can do deadly strikes from further distances.

The ship lacks the familiar armor stripes of the Osiris Alliance. The whole ship design is an accident of things just falling in place. Many of its properties are a direct copy of other third generation Osiris Alliance ships.",,,
oas_hexa,SHIP,"An old domain mining rig has been turned into a heavily armored battleship. The ship gets its name from the Hexagon shapes apparent on all around its design. The original shuttle landing pads have been turned to mount large weapons. All the outer surfaces have been treated with plenty of armor plating and coating. Port side is quite the same as the original Domain design. Two Large mining lasers have been tuned to weapons of war. It can launch two squadrons of Spitter wings. A modern launch bay is built on the starboard side. The ship has a huge volume of cargo space, originally designed to hold ore. Half of the space has been made to house large fuel tanks.

Hexagon is meant to take blows and in return obliterate whatever comes close enough. The problem is speed, no complains about the firepower and armor. At least a few commanders have had lasting mental damage where they had to witness carnage in front of their eyes, outside of the ships range. The hull is just a massive hunk of metal that is slow to accelerate even with the largest of engines.",,,
oas_osiris,SHIP,"Based on the classic Hexagon class. The internal systems have been upgraded to fully support an ORB installation. The ORB has been succesfully tuned to provide both plasma and laser shots. The first reports of Osiris class ships were dissmissed as impossible in the core worlds. An altercation with rogue Onslaught was captured by a Hegemony spy. The recording caused a big fuzz in the Hegemony military intelligence circles. The Osiris Alliance was supposed to be a bunch of poor colonies no one should care about, and suddenly they could fight toe to toe against the biggest Hegemony arsenal? A few top level Hegemony officials were demoted due to failure to handle the Osiris Alliance properly before they became a system wide power.",,,
oas_rhino,SHIP,"A ship designed to protect trade convoys. Rhino is based on the Unicorn hull, the legendary domain design favoured by many salvage captains. More armor was built around the already sturdy hull. The large mining laser mount was fitted for ballistic weaponry and additional point defense mounts were added on the starboard side. The built in mining shuttle bays were modified to support any fighter or bomber wing.

While the Rhino can't match other hulls in its class in speed, it can outgun and surprise them with a ballistic drive. It's voluminous hull ensures incredible logistic capabilities and Rhino is often used as a logistic ship in military fleets. Rhino is self sufficient during longer voyages and it has the ability to send a fighter wing to escort weaker ships.

Due to simple derivative additions on top of the widespread Unicorn hull, Osiris Alliance could not keep the blueprints secret and the design has spread trough every corner of the Persian system. Everyone likes a sturdy Rhino in their fleet.",,,
oas_owl,SHIP,"A third generation design based on feedback from Lasher Mk. II pilots. The largest drawback was the lack of point defense capabilities. This was fixed by adding a 360 degree ballistic mount. This made the hull bulky, and the design went trough numerous iterations until it was no longer even close to the original Lasher Mk II hit'n'run concept. Owl is more of a hit'n'watch-your-enemies-explode kind of a ship.",,,
oas_lasher2,SHIP,"A cheap Lasher hull was chosen to work as a base for a speedy, but cheap frigate to act as an interceptor and hit'n'run vessel. Most of the weapon mounts were stripped, the crew compartment now holds a medium sized ballistic hardpoint. The new crew compartment was copied from the Viper. The most impressive part is the brand new engine maneuvering jets combined with the ammo feed system. Unlike the original Lasher, most of the cargo hold and fuel tanks make room for larger engines. The ship can still make small hyperspace trips on its own. But a support vessel is almost a requirement for Lasher Mk. II to make any actual use of it.",,,
oas_unicorn,SHIP,"Every explorers wet dream, unless they are rich enough to buy an apogee. A rare sight in the core systems as it is regarded mainly for long range exploration and salvage missions. Humane working conditions and human maintainable systems have made this ship a favored job designation by spacers. The ship got its name from the Heavy Mining Laser on it's front, sticking out like a unicorns alicorn.

This is one of latest hull designs created after the collapse. The original blueprint was made right after the collapse with Domain systems in mind. The design ran into multiple alterations before the first AI war, many of the original parts were no longer manufactured or attainable. New, easier to build and more human maintainable solutions were used. After the war, every hint of an AI was scrapped and human usable terminals were designed over them.",,,
oas_saltire,SHIP,"A modern carrier with enough armor to work as a frontline battleship. It has an impressive ballistic frontal battery. On top of it is a large ballistic mount that can be pointed in any direction. Saltire is the second design attempt by the Alliance to build a carrier with four launch bays. Lessons learned from the Crux, fixed requirements and a new contractor made the project a success. Every project goal was met, but the price soared. Only the most succesful fleet commanders have the money to field Saltire.",,,
oas_tusker,SHIP,"A large combat freighter with big guns. Tusker works as a auxiliary tanker and freighter, it also protects fleets from other cruisers on the battlefield. Built to answer the modified Colossus freighters run by the pirates and pathers. The hull made its way to the hearts of trade fleet commanders. It has shown that fleets that have Tuskers are statistically less interrupted by pirate raids.",,,
oas_observer,SHIP,"Fast and a big hull, the first Osiris Alliance class equipped with the ORB (Osiris Radar Ball). Built to act as a command vessel along fast moving frigates and destroyers. For a period of time Observer captains did not come around the Alliance space, they were only allowed to do salvage and survey missions way from the core worlds. The ships were succesfully held as a secret for a long time. Fueling and resupply arrangements were handled by the specops department. These secret logistic maneuvers made it possible to grow the fleet to impressive scale. Intelligence circles didn't connect the sightings to Osiris Alliance until it was too late to stop producing them without a full scale war.",,,
oas_blaster_drone,SHIP,"A semi-autonomous mining shuttle equipped with a Mining Blaster and a small cargo bay to transport material back to the mothership. The pilots main task is to supervise the Mining Blaster, ensure it's not pointed at the wrong target. The second task is to handle the retrieval of possible valuables, after the Spitter has pulverized the target.",,,
oas_beetle,SHIP,"A heavy duty fighter meant to empty the surrounding space from other fighters. Dual vulcans, along with a shield penetrating railgun is enough firepower to bring down anything smaller than a frigate. Heavy armor ensures the Beetle survives the engagement.",,,
oas_hml,WEAPON,"This is a big Laser meant to cut ship hulls and asteroids into pieces. A proprietary, special purpose liquid hydrogen cooling system is a required to mount the laser. A special certification process must be met by the ship hull, and a high cost course must be passed by the crew members whose job is to maintain the system. This stopped adoption for the tool quickly and the design decisions caused careers to end prematurely. Rumor has it that the laser never hit the required proft margins it was meant to.",,,
oas_s_cannon,WEAPON,"The mathematics of superconductive Magnetron projectiles tell us that smaller projectiles allow for exponentially more of them to be fired within a timeframe. Two barrels even the flux flow from the chemical combustions. Most of the flux generated by the payload accelerator system goes out along with the projectile, making this version of the Magnetron Cannon very flux efficient.",,,
oas_s_pd,WEAPON,A point defense ballistic weapon with ammunition buffering system enabling quick bursts towards incoming missiles and fighters. Continuous firing causes the barrels thermal protection systems to kick in  resulting in a more spray and pray type of weapon. A deadly weapon in the right hands.,,,
oas_m_cannon,WEAPON,A medium version of the Magnetron Cannon. Causes hard damage to shields thanks to the fast spinning kinetic payload. Not the most efficient weapon to penetrate hulls but incredible tool against shields.,,,
oas_m_blazer,WEAPON,"Two thermal shapers transform molten mass into a wide, thin arc of plasma that gets propelled forward by controlled combustion. Upon hitting hull, the plasma arc cuts trough matter like butter. The massive thermal flux that roams inside the thermal shaper make the resulting projectile trajectory hard to predict, making accurate corrections to the recoil impossible by common means resulting in a below average accuracy.",,,
oas_m_pd,WEAPON,"A double barreled version of the Star Sprayer point defense weapon system. Saturates the space around any ship with fast moving projectiles, seemingly creating a ballistic shield that can't be penetrated by missiles. A thought quickly forgotten when a missile eventually manages to get past the projectiles.",,,
oas_xlcannon,WEAPON,"A heavy projectile is propelled by chemical combustion. A large coil system activates hundreds of smaller projectiles inside the primary shell to spin around in a superconductive magnetic railing system. The magnetic field measures upto 100 Tesla, causing a glowing red plasma around the projectile in the vacuum of space. Upon impact, the shell ruptures and the magnetic system ceases to exist, freeing the fast moving matter. This unleashes immensive kinetic energy to whatever it hits.",,,
oas_xl_blazer,WEAPON,Voted as the most efficient pirate repellant around the Persean system. The large shaped plasma arcs destroy the will of any opposing force that dares to come close enough. There's not a single spacer who would willingly would want to see a thin plasma arc cut trough their crewmates.,,,
oas_trident_large,WEAPON,"The ultimate long range missile system. A single launch sends three Trident missiles towards the target ship. A trident missile has three Harpoon missiles inside. Once a Trident missile gets close enough, it breaks apart and unleashes the three harpoon missiles, a total of 9 harpoons. The missiles are usually used as a finisher, or as a battle initializer and finalizer.",,,
oas_miningblaster_fighter,WEAPON,"The miner's best friend in a miniatyre size, this weapon can deliver pulverizing bolts of energy at medium range, albeit at extreme cost in flux.",,,
oas_orb,WEAPON,This large ORB(Osiris Radar Ball) has been tuned to fire a burst of electrically charged plasma projectiles.,,,
oas_owl_orb,WEAPON,This miniatyre ORB(Osiris Radar Ball) has been tuned to fire a deadly laser blast.,,,
oas_ai_orb_plasma,WEAPON,This large ORB(Osiris Radar Ball) has been tuned to fire a short burst of large electrically charged plasma projectiles.,,,
oas_ai_orb_laser,WEAPON,This large ORB(Osiris Radar Ball) has been succesfully tuned to the max to fire a deady short laser bursts.,,,
oas_grb_laser,WEAPON,This medium sized ORB(Osiris Radar Ball) has been tuned to work as a point defense burst laser.,,,

station_harman,CUSTOM,This huge orbital fuel depot was created to make the large distance manageable to smaller trade fleets and travelers on their way to the Osiris Alliance territory. Some of the travelers get stuck here after spending their lifesavings on untrustworthy starline captains. The mining colony below is a good as place for work as any other hole in the Persean system. Any fleet wishing to fill their tanks here must have bought their share in advance from an auction system months before their trip.,,"The halls are full of people, most of them suffering from long term effects of being in a closed space for too long. The station is clearly split apart, those fortune enough to have made their bids for fuel early in advance are treated as VIP customers. Everyone else is just left on their own.",
planet_harman,CUSTOM,A small mining colony far away from everything. Osiris Alliance has a small outpost installed here. The local ore resources are not considered important by anyone else but the local population. The fuel station orbiting the planet is a very important part of allowing traders to move freely between the core systems and Bereer star system. The spaceport acts as a resting place for passing by traders. It has gained a recent boom in surplus crew from all the travelers who got stuck on the depot.,,"A small mining colony, you notice there is a patrol HQ with the Osiris Alliance colors.",
planet_fura,CUSTOM,"A volcanic planet with ever changing mountain ranges due to hourly tectonic activity. It hosts a small mining colony who have managed to activate Domain era planetary shield and defences. Stubbornly, they are still independent. Negotiations are ongoing for them to officially join the Osiris Alliance. Only a few key point remains as an obsticle for the deal.",,"Fura is a fiery volcanic planet, covered by clouds of ash. The tectonic activity is caused by the gravity of the gas giant Airo that has a tidal lock on the planet. The few mines operated here are protected by domain constructed domes.",
planet_suns_gate,CUSTOM,"This planet has been bombarded to ruins multiple times. Covered in glass dust. It holds a vast array of technology treasures from the Domain era. While the surface is a dry desert, ruins are found under every dune and underneath the large ruined cities are vast underground water reserves, built by the domain long ago. The planet has become a booming center for new entrepreneurs and it's now a home for thousands of new corporations fighting to become the next big thing.",,"Your sensors shows hundreds, if not thousands of population centers around the desert surface. The air is dry, a bit hot. Radio wave bandwitdh is full of business chatter, commercials and encrypted transmissions. You could choose any of the available market hub here to do your business. Active competition between markets ensures you won’t get nothing but the best prices.",
planet_eria,CUSTOM,"One the most pleasant climates one can find in the persian system. Only a small part of the land is under use, yet the planet could potentially feed half of the people in the persian system. The planet is protected by a local military base.",,A single large military base is apparent in the vast sanctum paradise of what seems to be an infinite amount of organics and fresh water. Is this what the legendary Earth was like?,
osiris,FACTION,"Named after the legendary salvage captain Osiris Sun. The Osiris Alliance is ruled by a board of directors. Any corporate entity that has enough credits can buy their seat on the table. Against the original spirit of the Alliance, this fee seems to steadily raise. The Osiris Alliance is the entity responsible for the governing and military security of the few worlds joined in the alliance. Before independency its main responsibility was to fight against pirates, during the AI wars it protected civilian populations as best as it could. After the declaration of free enterprise and independency, protection against possible invasion by the Hegemony became a new focus for the 

The Alliance was born with the idealogy of free enterprise. Anyone is free to join their world and start building their own enterprises. This has made the Alliance worlds gain a steady flow of people from the core Persean systems. The planets are full of Domain technology, ripe to be picked up and used again. Surprisingly, completely new technology has started to emerge from the ashes due to the free capitalistic system. Even monopolies have started to emerge, causing internal stress and conflicts.",,,
